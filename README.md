## Special Minimal UI Features

### Dynamic Mode (Default: OFF)
Auto-Hides UI elements after Chat inactivity or when switching scenes.
This allows making up space intelligently for you to save space during actual game
without having to manually hide unwanted elements.

### Organized Minimize (Default: ON)
Intelligently positions minimized windows in a dedicated horizontal area, and 
allows displaying a taskbar for it. This helps to find minimized windows quickly.
Organized Minimize+ Setting allows colouring minimized windows to find them quicker

# Support with Systems and Modules
MinimalUI is made as agnostic as possible. Yet, it is impossible to ensure maximum compatibility.
I invite you to share any systems or modules that conflict with MinimalUI or do not look correctly.
Also do share systems and modules Minimal UI already works with too!

# Build from Source
